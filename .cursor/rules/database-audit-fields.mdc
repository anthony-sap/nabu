# Database Audit Standards

## Overview

All database models in Nabu must include comprehensive audit fields to ensure full traceability of data changes, support multi-tenancy, and enable soft deletes.

## Required Audit Fields

Every model in `prisma/schema.prisma` must include the following fields:

### Multi-tenancy
- **`tenantId`** - String (nullable for some shared models)
  - Links record to a specific tenant for data isolation
  - Indexed for query performance

### Audit Timestamps
- **`createdAt`** - DateTime @default(now())
  - Automatically set when record is created
  - Never modified after creation

- **`updatedAt`** - DateTime @updatedAt
  - Automatically updated by Prisma on any change
  - Tracks last modification time

### Audit Users
- **`createdBy`** - String (nullable)
  - User ID of the creator
  - Set once at creation

- **`updatedBy`** - String (nullable)
  - User ID of last modifier
  - Updated on every change

### Soft Delete Support
- **`deletedAt`** - DateTime? (optional)
  - Null = active record
  - Set = soft deleted record
  - Enables data recovery and audit trail

- **`deletedBy`** - String? (optional)
  - User ID who performed soft delete
  - Used for accountability

## Automatic Handling

These fields are automatically managed by Prisma middleware located in `lib/dbMiddleware.ts`:

- `createdBy` and `updatedBy` are automatically populated from the authenticated user context
- `createdAt` and `updatedAt` are handled by Prisma decorators
- `deletedAt` is set when performing soft deletes
- Queries automatically exclude soft-deleted records unless explicitly included
